<P> The corpora are collected from publicly available sources by  a web crawler. 
The crawler checks for language, so as to mainly  get texts consisting of the 
desired language*.
<P>  Each entry is tagged with it's date of publication. Where user comments 
 are included they will be tagged with the date of the main entry. 
<P>  Each entry is tagged with the type of entry, based on the type of  website 
it is collected from (e.g. newspaper or personal blog)  If possible, each entry 
is tagged with one or more  subjects based on the title or keywords of the entry 
(e.g. if the  entry comes from the sports section of a newspaper it will be 
tagged  with "sports" subject).<BR> In many cases it's not feasible to tag the 
entries (for example,  it's not really practical to tag each individual Twitter 
entry,  though I've got some ideas which might be implemented in the future) or 
no subject is found by the automated process, in which case the  entry is tagged 
with a '0'.
<P>  To save space, the subject and type is given as a numerical code.
<P>  Once the raw corpus has been collected, it is parsed further, to  remove 
duplicate entries and split into individual lines.  Approximately 50% of each 
entry is then deleted. Since you cannot  fully recreate any entries, the entries 
are anonymised and this is  a non-profit venture I believe that it would fall 
under  <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">Fair Use.</A><BR><BR><A

<BR><BR> * You may still find lines of entirely different languages in the 
 corpus. There are 2 main reasons for that:<BR> 1. Similar languages. Some 
languages are very similar, and the  automatic language checker could therefore 
erroneously accept the foreign language text.<BR> 2. "Embedded" foreign 
languages. While a text may be mainly in the  desired language there may be 
parts of it in another language. Since  the text is then split up into 
individual lines, it is possible to  see entire lines written in a foreign 
language.<BR> Whereas number 1 is just an out-and-out error, I think number 2 is 
 actually desirable, as it will give a picture of when foreign  language is used 
within the main language.
